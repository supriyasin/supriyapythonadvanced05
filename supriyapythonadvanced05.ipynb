    "#Q1. What is the meaning of multiple inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Before moving on to understand multiple inheritance in Python, let's first take a brief look at the concept of \n",
    "   inheritance itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "   When you're born, you look similar to your parents, and that essentially means that you \"inherited\" the qualities \n",
    "   or characteristics of your parents. In the same way, in Python when we talk about classes and objects, we have certain \n",
    "   classes (child classes) that we define, which \"inherit\" from other classes (parent classes). If we create sub-classes \n",
    "   of the child classes, they would inherit the properties of the parent class as well.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   You can read more about inheritance in Python here.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Now let's move on to multiple inheritance in Python. If a child class is inheriting the properties of a single \n",
    "   other class, we call it single inheritance. However, if a child class inherits from more than one class, i.e. this \n",
    "   child class is derived from multiple classes, we call it multiple inheritance in Python. This newly derived child \n",
    "   class will inherit the properties of all the classes that it is derived from. A very simple real life example would \n",
    "   be the one discussed above - a child inheriting properties of the father and mother.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Syntax of Multiple Inheritance in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "   Moving on to the syntax of multiple inheritance in Python, it is much similar to that of single inheritance. \n",
    "   For this example, we're not adding any code to the class, the 'pass' statement will simply skip the code and move ahead.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   class BaseClass1:\n",
    "\t# Body of base class 1 (parent class 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "class BaseClass2:\n",
    "\t# Body of base class 2 (parent class 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "class DerivedClass(BaseClass1, BaseClass2):\n",
    "\t# Body of derived class (child class)\n",
    "\t# Inherited properties of baseclass1 and baseclass2\n",
    "\n",
    "  Here, we have defined two classes which would be the parent classes of our new derived class. The derived class \n",
    "  will have the properties of BaseClass1 as well as BaseClass2 as specified in the code above, i.e. the child has \n",
    "  properties of both parents. Let us now look at an example of multiple inheritance in Python.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Multiple Inheritance in Python Example\n",
    "\n",
    "  We had taken a simple example in the beginning to understand the basic concept of inheritance - the inheritance of \n",
    "  characteristics of parents by the child. Let's try to implement this same example in code to demonstrate multiple \n",
    "  inheritance in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "  For this example, we will create two parent classes -- the father class, and the mother class. Each of these classes \n",
    "  will have its own methods. Post that, we will create a child class that inherits from both the classes. We will then \n",
    "  try to call the functions of the parent classes from the derived class (child class) object. Here's how it will be \n",
    "  done in Python:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  # creating class for father\n",
    "class Dad():\n",
    "\t# writing a method for parent class 1\n",
    "\tdef singing(self):\n",
    "\t\tprint(\"Dad sings well\")\n",
    "\t\t\n",
    "# creating a class for mother\n",
    "class Mom():\n",
    "\t# method for parent class 2\n",
    "\tdef coding(self):\n",
    "\t\tprint(\"Mom codes well\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# creating derived class\n",
    "class Child(Dad, Mom):\n",
    "\tdef play(self):\n",
    "\t\tprint(\"Kid loves to play\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# creating object of the new derived class\n",
    "child = Child()\n",
    "# calling methods of parent classes and derived class\n",
    "child.singing()\n",
    "child.coding()\n",
    "child.playing()\t\t\n",
    "\n",
    "  Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dad sings well\n",
    "Mom codes well\n",
    "Kid loves to play\n",
    "\n",
    "  As we can see in the output, the child class that was derived from Dad() and Mom() classes have the properties of both \n",
    "  the parent / base classes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The Diamond Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "  The diamond problem is a typical problem that is faced in multiple inheritance in Python. It is essentially an \n",
    "  ambiguity that is arisen when there are two classes say B and C that inherit / are derived from a single class A, \n",
    "  and there is another class D, that is a class derived from multiple inheritance and inherits from B as well as C.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This is a problem, because, as mentioned above, there is an ambiguity that arises -- which methods should the \n",
    "  class D inherit? It might also happen that multiple copies of the objects of the parent class - A would be inherited \n",
    "  by the child class D.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Let's take an example to understand better. We're going to create the 4 classes person, father, mother, and child as in \n",
    "  the structure above. The classes - father and mother would be derived from the person class, and the child class would \n",
    "  be derived from both father and mother (multiple inheritance).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  class Person:\n",
    "\tdef display(self):\n",
    "\t\tprint(\"Person called\")\n",
    "\t\n",
    "class Father(Person):\n",
    "\tdef display(self):\n",
    "\t\tprint(\"Father called\")\n",
    "\t\n",
    "class Mother(Person):\n",
    "\tdef display(self):\n",
    "\t\tprint(\"Mother called\")\n",
    "\t\n",
    "class Child(Father, Mother):\n",
    "\tpass\n",
    "\t\n",
    "child_obj = Child()\n",
    "child_obj.display()\n",
    "\n",
    "  With this code, we have created the diamond inheritance structure between the classes person, father, mother, and child.\n",
    "  How? The problem is created because when we try to call the display() function that the child_object has inherited from \n",
    "  the parent classes, we do not know which display()function would be called. Would it call the father class display function \n",
    "  or the mother class display function? In this case, the output shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "  Output:\n",
    "  Father called\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q2. What is the concept of delegation?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"If you want an object to pass attribute access requests to another object it contains, rather than handling them itself \n",
    "  or inheriting the attributes from a parent class, you can use delegation. This can be useful for implementing a proxy or for \n",
    "  an alternative to inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Delegation is a design pattern in which an object, called the delegate, is responsible for performing certain tasks \n",
    "  on behalf of another object, called the delegator. This can be done by the delegator forwarding method calls and attribute \n",
    "  access to the delegate. In its most basic form, delegation can be implemented using the following approach: the delegator \n",
    "  passes requests for certain actions to the delegate, which then performs the actions on behalf of the delegator.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In its simplest form, it often looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class A:\n",
    "  def spam(self, x):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "  def foo(self):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "class B:\n",
    "  def __init__(self):\n",
    "    self._a = A()\n",
    "  def spam(self, x):\n",
    "    # Delegate to the internal self._a instance\n",
    "    return self._a.spam(x)\n",
    "  def foo(self):\n",
    "    # Delegate to the internal self._a instance\n",
    "    return self._a.foo()\n",
    "  def bar(self):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "    \n",
    "    If there are only a couple of methods to delegate, writing code such as that just given is\n",
    "    easy enough. However, if there are many methods to delegate, an alternative approach\n",
    "    is to define the __getattr__() method, like this:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    class A:\n",
    "  def spam(self, x):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "  def foo(self):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "class B:\n",
    "  def __init__(self):\n",
    "    self._a = A()\n",
    "  def bar(self):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "    # Expose all of the methods defined on class A\n",
    "  def __getattr__(self, name):\n",
    "    return getattr(self._a, name)\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q3. What is the concept of composition?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Composition is one of the important concepts of Object-oriented programming (OOPs). Composition basically enables us \n",
    "   for creating complex types objects by combining other types of objects in the program. Composition represents ‘has a \n",
    "   relationship’ type or we can call composition as ‘has a relationship’ in the OOPs concept. It means that a composite \n",
    "   class present in the program can contains the objects from the other class components and this type of relationship \n",
    "   model is called as has a relationship.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Note: The classes that contains objects from the other classes in the program are called as composites whereas the \n",
    "   classes which we use to create more complex type of relationship models is called as components.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   In the above UML diagram, we have represented two different type of classes i.e., composites and components. \n",
    "   The relationship between the composites and components is the composition. As we can see that we have represented the \n",
    "   composition through a line where diamond from the composite class is pointing towards the components class representing \n",
    "   the composition relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "  In the composition relation, the composite class side represents the cardinality. Basically, the cardinality means the \n",
    "  number of valid ranges or objects of the components class that a composite class is containing in it. As we can see in \n",
    "  the above diagram, the 1 in the composite class represents only object of component class type is present in the composite \n",
    "  class through composition.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  We can express the cardinality of the composition through the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "    . By using a number (1, 2, 3, etc.)\n",
    "    . By using the * symbol\n",
    "    . By defining a range in composite (1...3, 2...5 etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "  Composition allows us to reuse our code by adding objects with the other new objects, the feature which is not present \n",
    "  in the inheritance concept.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  We know that Python is object-oriented programming language so it also follows the composition method. In Python, \n",
    "  the composition allows us to reuse the implementation of the component class object in the composite classes. We have \n",
    "  to remember that the composite class is not actually inheriting the component class interface but it is adapting the \n",
    "  interface of instances of component class.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The composition relationship in Python between composite class and component class is considered as loosely coupled. \n",
    "  It means that if we make changes in component class, it will rarely affect the composite class and if we make changes \n",
    "  in the composite class, it will never affect the component class. This feature of composition in Python provides us better \n",
    "  adaptability with the changes. It also allows us to introduce new changes in the application according to the requirements \n",
    "  without affecting the existing code.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  First, we will understand this through a basic example where we will use the basic concept of composition in our Python \n",
    "  program and then we will move forward with the use of composition.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "\n",
    " # create a component class in program\n",
    " class ComponentClass:\n",
    " # create the composite class constructor in component\n",
    "             def __init__(self):\n",
    "                         print('An object for the Component class is created ...')\n",
    "             # using the composite class instance method\n",
    "             def mk1(self):\n",
    "                         print('The Component class method mk1() is executed successfully ...')\n",
    " # create a composite class in program\n",
    " class CompositeClass:\n",
    "             # create a class constructor for composite class\n",
    "             def __init__(self):\n",
    "                         # creating an instance for the component class\n",
    "                         self.inst1 = ComponentClass()                   \n",
    "                         print('An object for the Composite class is also created ...')\n",
    "             # creating a class instance method for composite class\n",
    "             def mk(self):             \n",
    "                         print('The Composite class method mk() is also successfully executed ...')\n",
    "                         # calling the mk1() method of component class in composite class\n",
    "                         self.inst1.mk1()\n",
    " # creating an instance for the composite class\n",
    " inst2 = CompositeClass()\n",
    " # calling out mk() method from the composite class\n",
    " inst2.mk() \n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    " An object for the Component class is created ...\n",
    " An object for the Composite class is also created ...\n",
    " The Composite class method mk() is also successfully executed ...\n",
    " The Component class method mk1() is executed successfully ... \n",
    " \n",
    "   Explanation: In the above given program, we have created two classes i.e., composite class and component class \n",
    "   and named them specifically. The ComponentClass and CompositeClass shares the ‘has a type’ relation between them \n",
    "   i.e., Composition relation. We have also created one object for both the classes. To use the composition between \n",
    "   the classes, we have created a constructor for the composition class. We can see that we also have defined two methods \n",
    "   into the respective classes i.e., mk() & mk1(). We have called out mk1() method of component class inside the mk() \n",
    "   method of composite class. So, whenever we will call out the mk1() in the program, the mk() method will also be \n",
    "   called out. We can also see this in the output of the program.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q4. What are bound methods and how do we use them?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"A bound method is the one which is dependent on the instance of the class as the first argument. It passes the \n",
    "   instance as the first argument which is used to access the variables and functions. In Python 3 and newer versions of \n",
    "   python, all functions in the class are by default bound methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Let’s understand this concept with an example:\n",

    "obj = A()\n",
    "\n",
    "# bound method\n",
    "print(obj.func)\n",

    "< bound method A.func of <__main__.A object at 0x7fb81c5a09e8>>\n",
    "\n",
    "   obj.func(arg) is translated by python as A.func(obj, arg).\n",
    "\n",
    "  The instance obj is automatically passed as the first argument to the function called and hence the first parameter \n",
    "  of the function will be used to access the variables/functions of the object.\n",
